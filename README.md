## Folder structure

The workspace contains four folders, where:

- `.vscode`: the folder to maintain VSCode settings and launching settings
- `bin`: the folder to maintain compiled classes
- `lib`: the folder to maintain dependencies
- `src`: the folder to maintain sources

## Installing

(Windows) To install the solver, you have to have installed javaFX and latest java jdk. After installing java and javaFX follow these next steps:
Download the GameOfLife.jar file and waffle-game-solver.vbs.

Run solver by running waffle-game-solver.vbs.
